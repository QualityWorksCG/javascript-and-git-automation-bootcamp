You just got a new Job as a teacher, and you have a bunch of exam paper to mark.

From the following list of papers check if each individual one is submitted, and if so send that paper for marking which is a async function.

```js
const listOfPapers = [
    {
        subject: "Math",
        wasSubmitted: true,
        markPaper: () => {
           
        } 
    },
     {
        subject: "Geology",
        wasSubmitted: true,
        markPaper: () => {
            
        } 
    },
    {
        subject: "Social Studies",
        wasSubmitted: false,
        markPaper: () => {
            
        } 
    },
]
```
